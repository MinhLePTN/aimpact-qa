# üß™ Automation Test

```
Please help me set up the initial file and folder structure to start writing automation tests for the "User Login" feature.

- First, read the package.json file to detect which testing framework is being used
- Based on the detected framework, generate a recommended file and folder structure to organize the test code.
- Follow the test case document located in `docs/test-suite/test-case/TC01-Login-Test-Case.docx`.
- Create only the initial automation structure and sample test file for login, without writing the full test logic yet.

Requirements:
- Include a base folder for tests
- Include sample config or support files if needed
- Place all automation code outside the `docs/` folder

Do not overwrite existing files. Create only new folders and files required to start automation.
```

  3. Folder Structure (with brief explanations)
  4. Tech Stack and Frameworks (read from package.json)
  5. Installation Instructions
  6. How to Run the App

# üîí Gitignore .env

Include the following patterns if they are not already listed:

Avoid adding duplicates. Do not remove existing ignore rules.
